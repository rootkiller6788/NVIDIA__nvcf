# NVCF LLM Request Router Helm Chart

This repository contains the Helm chart for deploying the NVCF LLM Request Router (Stargate) on Kubernetes.

## Overview

The chart packages the LLM Request Router StatefulSet with HTTP and gRPC
services, a metrics endpoint, and a headless service for multi-instance DNS
discovery. It can also deploy the Stargate Kubernetes backend router for
worker gRPC registration and reverse QUIC tunnels through a shared Gateway or
load balancer. The backend router selects the correct Stargate pod from gRPC
authority and QUIC SNI.

A Vault Agent sidecar is configured to fetch a service token from a Vault or
OpenBao backend. The application reads `nvcfApiToken` from
`/vault/secrets/secrets.json` and attaches it as a Bearer token to outgoing
worker authentication gRPC calls.

The default chart values do not set the required image registry and repository. They must be supplied through an additional values file at install time, and access to those images must be arranged separately.

Example:

```yaml
llmRequestRouter:
  image:
    registry: <your-registry>
    repository: <your-org>/llm-request-router
    tag: <appVersion>
```

Single-replica deployments may use self-only discovery with `llmRequestRouter.discovery.disableDnsDiscovery=true`. Multi-replica deployments require DNS discovery and stable per-pod identity, so the chart fails rendering if DNS discovery is disabled while `llmRequestRouter.replicaCount > 1`. For multi-replica deployments, the default advertised hostname template is `{pod_name}.<headless-service>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local`; the StatefulSet and headless service provide the stable pod DNS names required for router replicas to discover each other and share backend registrations.

`llmRequestRouter.kubernetes.advertisedHostnameTemplate` supports the Stargate placeholders `{pod_name}` and `{namespace}`. Stargate resolves both placeholders at runtime. For certificate validation, the chart substitutes the deployment namespace and a representative StatefulSet pod name. `{pod_name}` must stay within the leftmost DNS label when certificate coverage relies on a wildcard. When `llmRequestRouter.certificate.enabled=true`, `certificate.dnsNames` must cover the advertised hostname with either a case-insensitive exact name or a valid leftmost `*.` wildcard. A wildcard covers exactly one label and requires at least two suffix labels. For example, `*.nvcf.example.internal` covers `{pod_name}.nvcf.example.internal`, but `*.example.internal` does not cover `{pod_name}.nvcf.example.internal`.

Upgrading from a chart version that rendered a Deployment can briefly run both the old Deployment and new StatefulSet during `helm upgrade` while Helm replaces the workload kind.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster
- Helm 3.x
- `kubectl`
- A reachable Vault or OpenBao instance with a JWT authentication path configured for this service (or set `llmRequestRouter.vault.noVaultAnnotations: true` to disable Vault Agent injection)

## Getting Started

Install the chart with the default values plus your own overrides:

```bash
helm install llm-request-router llm-request-router \
  --namespace llm-request-router \
  --create-namespace \
  --values llm-request-router/values.yaml \
  --values path/to/values.yaml \
  --wait \
  --timeout 10m
```

Upgrade an existing release:

```bash
helm upgrade llm-request-router llm-request-router \
  --namespace llm-request-router \
  --values llm-request-router/values.yaml \
  --values path/to/values.yaml \
  --wait \
  --timeout 10m
```

Uninstall the release:

```bash
helm uninstall llm-request-router --namespace llm-request-router
```

## Configuration

The default chart configuration lives in `llm-request-router/values.yaml`.

Important settings to review before deployment:

- `llmRequestRouter.image.*` for the router container image
- `llmRequestRouter.imagePullSecrets` for private registry access
- `llmRequestRouter.replicaCount`, resource requests, and limits for your environment
- `llmRequestRouter.service.*` for HTTP, gRPC, metrics, and headless service ports
- `llmRequestRouter.backendRouter.*` for multi-replica worker gRPC and reverse-tunnel routing
- `llmRequestRouter.metrics.enabled` to expose the metrics port on the Service (default: `false`)
- `llmRequestRouter.metrics.serviceMonitor.enabled` to create a Prometheus `ServiceMonitor` (requires `metrics.enabled`)
- `llmRequestRouter.certificate.*` to let cert-manager issue the Stargate QUIC server certificate
- `llmRequestRouter.tls.*` to mount the TLS Secret and pass cert/key paths to Stargate
- `llmRequestRouter.tls.mode` to choose the source of the QUIC server identity. `certManager` (default) mounts the Secret cert-manager writes for `certificate.*`. `existingSecret` mounts a pre-created Secret instead: the chart renders no `Certificate` and adds no issuer dependency, `certificate.enabled` must stay `false`, `tls.secretName`, `tls.certPath`, and `tls.keyPath` are required, and the operator owns issuance, renewal, rotation, and recovery. The Secret must provide the `tls.crt` and `tls.key` entries. The chart cannot read a pre-created Secret, so it does not validate its SANs or expiry.
- `llmRequestRouter.pki.*` to provision the OpenBao service-issuing PKI hierarchy that cert-manager mints the Certificate from. Opt-in via `pki.enabled=true`. Mirrors the SIS chart's `hook-lls-migrations.yaml` pattern: a Helm pre-install/pre-upgrade Job runs the `nvcf-openbao-migrations` image with `CORE_MIGRATIONS_ENABLED=false` + `ADDONS_LLM_ENABLED=true` so only the LLM addon executes. `pki.allowedDomains` (comma-separated DNS suffixes) is required when enabled and is the OpenBao PKI role's `allowed_domains` security constraint. Typically this is `<customer-domain>,cluster.local`. Job-level fail-hard is handled by `restartPolicy: OnFailure` + `pki.backoffLimit` combined with the migrations image's `FAILED_MIGRATIONS` accumulator (image `>= 0.12.1`).
- `llmRequestRouter.vault.audience` for the projected ServiceAccount token audience used to authenticate to OpenBao
- `llmRequestRouter.vault.noVaultAnnotations` to disable Vault Agent injection (useful for local testing without OpenBao)

The default values include development-oriented placeholders. Override them before using the chart in any shared or production environment.

## Backend Worker Routing

Enable `llmRequestRouter.backendRouter.enabled` when workers reach a
multi-replica request router through a shared endpoint. Set both pylon dial
addresses to the external endpoints that workers can resolve:

```yaml
llmRequestRouter:
  backendRouter:
    enabled: true
    image:
      tag: <published-stargate-version>
    pylonGrpcDialAddress: llm-router.example.com:443
    pylonReverseTunnelDialAddress: llm-router.example.com:8080
```

The chart uses the main Stargate image for both workloads. The image must
contain `/usr/local/bin/stargate-k8s-router`. Set
`llmRequestRouter.backendRouter.image.tag` to an image version that contains
that binary. The chart requires this explicit pin when backend routing is
enabled.

The backend router watches EndpointSlices. The chart creates a dedicated
ServiceAccount by default and binds a namespaced Role to it when
`llmRequestRouter.rbac.create=true`. When
`llmRequestRouter.backendRouter.serviceAccount.create=false`, set
`llmRequestRouter.backendRouter.serviceAccount.name` to an existing account.
When `rbac.create=false`, grant `get`, `list`, and `watch` on
`discovery.k8s.io/endpointslices` to that account outside this chart.

Route TCP port `50071` and UDP port `50072` to the
`llm-request-router-backend-router` Service. The NVCF gateway-routes chart can
create the matching `TCPRoute`, `UDPRoute`, and `ReferenceGrant` resources.
The Gateway implementation must support Gateway API `UDPRoute`.

When QUIC verification is enabled, the mounted certificate must cover the
worker-facing reverse-tunnel hostname and the per-pod hostname template. The
default template is
`{pod_name}.llm-request-router-headless.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local`.

Stargate and the backend router read the TLS certificate and key only during
process startup. After cert-manager or another issuer renews the Secret,
restart both workloads or configure a Secret reloader that triggers their
rollouts.

## Load Balancer Configuration

The chart can pass a Stargate load-balancer config in either of two ways:

- `llmRequestRouter.loadBalancer.config` embeds JSON directly in the release. The chart writes it to a ConfigMap and starts Stargate with `--lb-config-path=/etc/llm-request-router/lb-config.json`.
- `llmRequestRouter.loadBalancer.configPath` points Stargate at an existing file path and starts it with `--lb-config-path=<configPath>`.

`config` takes precedence over `configPath` when both are set. If neither value is set, Stargate uses its built-in default algorithm, `power-of-two`.

See the
[Stargate load balancer configuration](../../../src/libraries/rust/stargate/docs/load-balancer-configuration.md)
for the JSON schema, algorithm behavior, and tuning fields. See
[LLM Request Router Load Balancing](../../../docs/user/llm-request-router-load-balancing.md)
for stack ownership, trusted headers, rollout checks, and troubleshooting.

## Local Render

```bash
helm template llm-request-router llm-request-router
```

## Notes

- If you publish or mirror the required images into another registry, set the image registry, repository, tag, and pull secret values explicitly in your override file.
