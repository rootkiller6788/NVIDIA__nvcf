# Stargate

Stargate is a control plane and HTTP router for inference servers.

- Pylons register local inference servers with Stargate.
- Stargate keeps local routing state by model and routing key.
- Clients send OpenAI-compatible HTTP requests to Stargate.
- Stargate forwards each request over an established QUIC tunnel to a selected pylon.

Two backend connectivity configurations are first-class:

- **Edge/direct:** Stargate and pylons share a network. Pylon listens on a
  reachable QUIC address and Stargate connects directly. No reverse listener
  or `stargate-k8s-router` is required.
- **Cloud/reverse:** pylons cannot accept connections from Stargate. Each pylon
  connects to a Stargate reverse listener, optionally through
  `stargate-k8s-router` or a load balancer.

Set the same `--backend-connectivity=direct|reverse` topology on Stargate and
pylon. The [local quickstart](docs/getting-started/local-quickstart.md) uses the
Edge/direct path. On Stargate, a reverse listener
(`--reverse-tunnel-listen-addr`) requires `--backend-connectivity=reverse`; the
mismatched combination is rejected at startup.

Pylon model membership is either an explicit repeatable `--model-name` set or,
when that flag is omitted, a continuously discovered Dynamo `GET /v1/models`
set. Every Pylon must also select exactly one local stats initialization source:
`--do-calibration` for a sole Pylon in its cluster or a per-Pylon
`--initial-input-tps` value for shared-hardware clusters. See
[Pylon onboarding](docs/operations/pylon-onboarding.md) for the complete
lifecycle and calibration contract.

Pylon gates startup on an upstream health probe. It tries `/health` and then
`/v1/health/ready`, reuses whichever path answers first, and forwards Stargate's
`/health` RTT probe to that same path, so engines that serve only the
OpenAI-style ready endpoint work without extra configuration. The repeatable
`--upstream-health-path` puts your own paths ahead of those defaults, which stay
in place as a fallback, and `--upstream-health-wait-ms` bounds how long startup
retries the probe (default 60000; `0` probes once and exits).

Use [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) as the docs entrypoint.
Use [local quickstart](docs/getting-started/local-quickstart.md) to run the local stack.

For the local Kubernetes stack:

```bash
make cluster-kind
make tilt-up-kind
```

To render or apply the standalone Edge example instead:

```bash
kubectl kustomize kustomize/overlays/edge
kubectl apply -k kustomize/overlays/edge
```

Stopping the Make-managed Tilt process cleans up its Kubernetes resources,
namespaces, and instance-scoped CoreDNS rewrite. Calling `tilt up` directly
bypasses that cleanup wrapper.
For the CI-style integration run, use
`python3 scripts/run_tilt.py ci --context kind-kind --timeout 30m`; it performs
the same teardown after Tilt exits.

In Kubernetes, pod identity and headless DNS provide discovery; they do not
enable peer relay. The built-in backend peer relay is a default-off,
development-only CLI option and must not be used in production. Use
[`stargate-k8s-router`](docs/operations/deployment-shape.md) or a supported
load-balancer topology for production backend traffic.

## Main Crates

- `crates/stargate`: server binary
- `crates/pylon` and `crates/pylon-lib`: sidecar CLI and library
- `crates/stargate-k8s-router`: optional backend-facing gRPC, Raw QUIC, and
  WebTransport router
- `crates/proto`: protobuf API
- `crates/protocol`: tunnel framing
- `crates/mock-dynamo`: local OpenAI-style backend
- `crates/stargate-bench`: benchmark runner

The versioned Stargate runtime image also includes
`/usr/local/bin/stargate-k8s-router`. Kubernetes deployments can run the main
Stargate process and the backend router from the same immutable image tag.

## Benchmarks

```bash
cargo run -p stargate-bench -- list-scenarios
cargo run -p stargate-bench -- run --scenario hotset-8-backends --output-dir .bench-out/hotset
cargo run --release -p stargate-bench -- transport-bench --requests 20000 --concurrency 256 --output-dir .bench-out/transport
```
